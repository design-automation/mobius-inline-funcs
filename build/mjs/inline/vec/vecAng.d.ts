 * - v1 can be one vector, and v2 can be one vector.
 * - v1 can be a list of vectors, and v2 can be one vector.
 * - v1 can be one vector, and v2 can be a list of vectors.
 * - v1 can be a list of vectors, and v2 can be a list of vectors. These lists should have the **same size**.
 * @param v1 The first vector or list of vectors.
 * @param v2 The second vector or list of vectors.
 * @returns An angle in radians.
